## Profound Images

An image can be visceral and loud </br>
as an angry crowd.

Clever, as kittens whisker after string,

Striking, as the toll-worn bell </br>
on sunday morning, past fears of hell —

An image can be spotless </br>
As the leopards hide.

-

An image can be nothing at all </br>
As the free fall,

Keeping, as the bird releases </br>
Twig by twig into love-enchanted nest,

Being, a vivid body of shadow and light, </br>  
Forever still in form and sight,

An image can be motionless in time </br>
As the mind rewinds.

-

An image can not be equal to; </br>
Yet can bet true.

For every moment - lost and found. </br>
Remember splendor - sight and sound.

For you, </br>
The endless skys and lights above the sea —

An image was, </br>
so now you see.
